# Flutter PDF Reader

## **Overview**
This Flutter application allows users to view PDF files seamlessly using three different methods:
1. Open PDFs from a **local file system**.
2. Open PDFs via a **URL**.
3. Open PDFs stored in the **assets folder**.

The app also includes a "Recent Files" feature, which enables quick access to the last five locally opened files.
